excerpt: "the red queen hypothesis"
---

species must constantly evolve to stay alive. not to get ahead, but to avoid dying.

this is the red queen hypothesis. it's named after a snippet in the novel *Through the Looking-Glass* where the queen says "now, *here*, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."

an example of the red queen in action is what happened with penicillin. when it was discovered in 1928, we finally had a weapon against bacteria. but within years the bacteria countered and evolved genetic mutations to resist penicillin. humans then developed stronger antibiotics (methicillin, vancomycin) to counter the bacteria's new resistance. the bacteria again evolved things like MRSA that further resist the humans' new drugs… and so the story continues.[^1]

why does this matter for you?

the red queen shows up in modern life too: the job market evolves, AI changes what skills matter, you lose mobility as you age… if you're not learning new skills and using new tools, someone using AI replaces you. if you're not moving physically, your muscle mass reduces. so you must always adapt and improve. not to win. but to merely get by.

i think most people get this twisted and use modern luxuries as an excuse to not move forward. having baseline needs taken care of is not an excuse to loaf around.

it's easier than ever to do nothing. to relax. it's also easier than ever to become a depressed bum.

[^1]: the red queen hypothesis also explains why sex exists. parasites exploit common genes. so by mixing DNA from two parents, every kid gets unique genetic combinations that parasites must figure out all over again, making it harder for them to kill us.
