excerpt: "morning routines vs missions"

it's interesting how we meme ourselves into living like automatons.

you tell yourself you're going to wake up at 6am, do pushups, read at least 10 pages, and do all these things.

but *why* cant you just find one thing you love to do and do *that*?

why do you assume that living like a literal npc, forcing yourself to do this and that, will help you become successful?

now i'm not saying that it wont.

i'm just saying that i have yet to read or listen to a biography where the person optimized their morning routine instead of obsessing over their mission.
